        MechRunner casts gamers as a mech that can switch between robot and tank modes, enabling them to blast their way through urban landscapes while defeating waves of enemies and rescuing civilians.

        It is being developed by Spark Plug Games, a studio that's previously worked on a number of PC and mobile games, including the iOS port of Puzzle Quest 2. For MechRunner, Spark Plug got film industry concept artist Josh Nizzi on board to help conceptualise and bring the mechs to life. Nizzi has a lot of experience in the area, having worked on hits like The Avengers, Iron Man, and Transformers.

        “I think we have some of the most detailed, amazing looking mechs to ever appear in a video game," says Ben Lichius, VP and Art Director at Spark Plug.

        Though MechRunner is reportedly already "feature complete," Spark Plug is running a Kickstarter campaign to help polish things up before its release. Backer rewards include early game access, in-game content, a soundtrack, and t-shirts.

        MechRunner is due for release in July.
